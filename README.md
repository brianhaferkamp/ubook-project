# The uBook Project
The official Universal Book (uBook) project

We have moved through the proprietary eBook era and are now entering a new era of digital publishing free from the constraints of proprietary eBook devices, file formats, and marketplaces. The new era of digital publishing is open, web-based, standards compliant, and accessible across platforms and devices. In other words, our books will now be universal.

The uBook Project is a first-of-its-kind project to envision, create, and distribute a new kind of digital book. At the beginning we will focus our energy on recreating some of the classic pieces of literature as we begin to structure and map out some standard features for uBooks.

The first uBook is the classic, *Moby Dick*. Read it online.

## uBook Development  Roadmap

- Create the next uBook: *Pride and Prejudice*
- Create a video showing developers how to make their own uBooks
- Create a central marketplace for uBooks

## What is a uBook?

A universal book (uBook) is a book that can be read on any device that includes a web browser. Created only with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, these books are as open and universal as the web.They can even be read on a dedicated eReader, such as the Kindle. 
In its essence, a uBook is a relatively basic web app. It can be single page or multi-page app.
