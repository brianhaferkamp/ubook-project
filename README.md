# The iBook Project
The official Universal Book (uBook) project

We have moved through the proprietary eBook era and are now entering a new era of digital publishing free from the constraints of proprietary eBook devices, file formats, and marketplaces. The new era of digital publishing is open, web-based, standards compliant, and accessible across platforms and devices. In other words, our books will now be universal.

The uBook Project is a first-of-its-kind project to envision, create, and distribute a new kind of book. At the beginning we will focus our energy on recreating some of the classic pieces of literature as we begin to structure and map out some standard features for uBooks.

The first uBook is the classic, *Moby Dick*. Read it online.

## uBook Roadmap

- Create the next uBook: *Pride and Prejudice*
- Create a video showing developers how to make their own uBooks
- Create a central marketplace for uBooks
